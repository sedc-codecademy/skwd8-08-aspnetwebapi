# Homework - Class 08

Use your SEDC.NotesApp project from Homework 06 

1. Add the Register and Login methods from Class 08

2. Configure the app for using JWT 

3. All the actions in UserController should require authorization, only the Login, Register and the action for retrieving all users shouldn't.

4. The action for editing a user should check if the user who is trying to do the Edit has the same id as the user being edited (each user can
edit only its profile). Hint: use the jwt token to get the user id.
